CS 185C/286 - Homework 2

3. My strategy for parsing the xml is to store the data as Question objects. each Question object will have
a question String( as denoted by the tag text in the xml) and a list of choices( as denoted by the tag choice).
I will thenstore all these Question object in and ArrayList called quiz.
I will use each event to store data for the list view. I will first take the question text from each event and make the first list. Then 
upon click a question in the first link, I will pass the event on and use it to create a second list of choices.

6. My plan is to use the method startActivity for result via intent to get the selected answer fromt eh second activity.
I will compare the chosen answer and compare it to the correct answer and then pass the result back to the MainActivity. 
I will then get that question's individual view in MainActivity
and if the return data is true, I will change the background to green else I will change it to red. Then I will set the 
onclickListener for that view to null so clicking will not work for it.
